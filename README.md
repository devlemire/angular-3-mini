# Project Summary

In this project, we'll implement routing into an Angular application. You'll notice that the `js/` folder has another level of folders inside of it. The Angular community has found the best way to organize your files, so your project can scale, is too break out your code into "features". Therefore, you'll find all the HTML and JS for each feature in its folder. Take a minute to get familiar with the file structure.

## Setup
